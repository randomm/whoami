## who i am?

I'm a guy who Santa brought a computer in 1983. I tried my hand at human sciences at university (University of London, Politics and Development Studies), but ended up working in internet, design and IT related roles past 18 years.

I have a varied background. I have worked at consultancies, directly at "client", at quite a few startups and even at two universities' research organisations. I'm a design oriented technologist who tries to put his skills to use to helping people.

I have always been doing pretty much the same thing:

1. learning what the problem is
2. defining potential solutions, involving design and technology
3. leading a team to build the solution
...
4. and in some lucky cases scaling the solution over the next few years

The last few years I have also been doing quite a bit of machine learning.


## what can I do?

Due to my varied background I have been exposed to all kinds of challenges and scenarios.

I have:

- worked as a client facing technologist (read: technical frontline sales)
- worked as a technical team leader
- worked in concept design
- worked as an engineering lead
- worked as a programmer

(... this is a really long list. I have even worked as a janitor, as a cleaner at the local processed meat factory (yikes, I'm so glad I'm nowadays on the path to veganism :), at a local city theatre, I have run my own renovations business etc, luckily now renovations-wise I'm only trying my hand at keeping our 100 years old wooden family house mended.)

I am also a trained people manager, have sat in the leadership teams of three companies, been the chairperson of a housing co-operative, taken part in multiple social innovation events as a mentor & judge.

What am I best at? Probably always the latest role I've had. Now its a startup CTO.

I usually try to go in people first. Technology is
